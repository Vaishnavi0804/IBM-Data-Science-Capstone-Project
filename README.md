# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

- In this project I have done analysis on SpaceX's Falcon9 launch data. 
- Analysis was done to determine the price of a new launch for the hypothetical company Space Y.
- Here, we also determine if SpaceX reuses the first stage of the launch using Machine Learning models.
- All the data analysis steps performed are done in Python.
- Folium and Plotly are used for creating maps and dashboards.
